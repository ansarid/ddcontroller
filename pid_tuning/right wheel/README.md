PID tuning in process.  Step response is healthy in positive and in negative directions at 4rad/s.  However, tests including a step followed by a return to zero have a delay and strong oscillations.  Yellow line representing error does not agree with (target - current) values.  Next step is to find this discrepancy in code and return to tuning the step response.j
