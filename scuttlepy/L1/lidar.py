# This File performs the following:
# 1) grab a subset of the readings from the lidar for lightweight purposes
# 2) assign the proper angle value to the reading, with respect to robot x-axis
# 3) create a 2d array of [distances, angles] from the data

# Note: installation of pysicktim library is required for to run this program.
# perform "sudo pip3 install pyusb," then "sudo pip3 install pysicktim"
