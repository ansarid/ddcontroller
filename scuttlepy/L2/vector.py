# This program manipulates distance vectors in the robot coordinate frame,
# as well as arrays of vectors.  Pay attention to format of arguments since
# some functions are not yet optimized to handle numpy [1x2] vectors directly.
# Further functions will be added for rotation of vectors in various coordinate frames.
